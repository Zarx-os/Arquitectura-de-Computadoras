@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\mau\documents\arqui\practicas\segundo parcial\01-key00\coder00.vhdl":22:1:22:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including K02.outcoderc[6].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
