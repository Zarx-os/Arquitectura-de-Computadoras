@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\mau\documents\arqui\practicas\segundo parcial\00-osc00-vhdl\div00.vhdl":21:2:21:3|Found inferred clock oscint00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including K0200.D01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
